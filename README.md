# Law of Demeter

Try to write a test for the method 'calculateDamage' on the Player class, without changing any of the production code. Give yourself a time box of 10 min, then reflect on why this method is hard to test.

When you have reflected, you should refactor the 'calculateDamage' method to better follow the Law of Demeter. Also add test cases to cover the functionality in the Player class.

When you feel that you are done, and have a few tests with good coverage of Player, you can address problems in the other classes. To help you, there are 'TODO' messages sprinkled over the code. Reflect on which of these TODO hints will now be easier to address compared with before your refactoring work.
