# Law of Demeter

Try to test the method calculateDamage on the Player class with a time box on 10 min.

After that try to make the method follow the law of demeter by extracting methods and moving them to the correct class. Some of the destination classes migth now break the law of demeter, but that is okay for now.

When you are done with the refactor try to test it again.

If you feel that you are done, and have a few tests. Try to do any of the todo that are sprinkled over the code. And reflect on which of them will now be easier to do then before the refactor.
